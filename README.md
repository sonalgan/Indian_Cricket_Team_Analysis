# Cricket Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical cricket match data to understand player performance and match outcomes. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model development. The goal is to predict top performers in cricket matches based on player clusters and match conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and related data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each phase of the analysis.
- `src/`: Python scripts used in the project.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations.

## Data Collection

In this phase, we collect historical cricket match data, including player statistics, match conditions, and performance metrics, from publicly available sources.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Feature Selection and Engineering

Key features that impact player performance are selected, and feature engineering is performed to create new meaningful features.

## Clustering Analysis

Players are grouped into clusters based on their playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses. This allows categorizing players into distinct clusters, each with its characteristics.

## Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to reduce dataset complexity while retaining crucial information for analysis.

## Model Building and Evaluation

We build an unsupervised learning model to predict top performers based on player clusters and match conditions. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Interpretation and Recommendation

The report provides insights into the factors contributing to player performance and match outcomes. Recommendations are made for cricket teams and analysts.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into cricket data analysis and offers practical recommendations for improving team strategies.

## Future Improvements

Explore opportunities for further improvements in data analysis, including analyzing opponent teams, focusing on T20 matches, and real-time data integration.
